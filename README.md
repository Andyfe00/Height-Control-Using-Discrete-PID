# Height-Control-Using-Discrete-PID

This project implements the **height control of a hydraulic system** using a **discrete PID controller**, modeled and simulated in **MATLAB/Simulink**, implemented in **LabVIEW**, and validated on a **microcontroller (Arduino)**.

## üß† Overview

The objective of this work was to **design and simulate a DC motor speed control system** capable of following **step** and **ramp** reference signals while considering real-world **saturation effects** (voltage, current, and maximum speed).

The project consists of three main parts:
1. **Mathematical modeling** of the hydraulic system.
2. **Design and discretization of a PID controller** using MATLAB/Simulink.
3. **Hardware implementation** of the discrete controller in LabVIEW with serial communication to Arduino.
